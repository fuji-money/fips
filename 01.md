# FIP-01

Basic protocol flow description
-------------------------------

There are two main [covenants](#covenants) that regulates the issuance and the burn of any synthetic assets (from now on **Synth**): the **Safe covenant** and the **Mint covenant**


## Safe

There are two types of Safe covenant:

- Unlimited Safe3
- Prime Safe

## Mint

The contract for minting Synth is split into two stages, Mint1 and Mint2. In the first stage, the reissuance token (RT) is used to mint an arbitrary amount of Synth, which is then sent to the second stage covenant. The second stage covenant releases the Synth only if the appropriate amount of collateral is locked in the Safe covenant.

The first stage covenant constructs the second stage covenant using oracle-attested price data and ensures that the Synth is sent to the same covenant that was constructed. The second stage covenant has two branches: one releases the Synth if the collateral is locked and the other allows anyone to burn the locked Synth if the oracle-attested price data used in the first stage is out-of-date.

The second stage covenant uses two timelocks to ensure that the oracle-attested price data used in the first stage is recent. The minter is expected to release the Synth and lock their collateral within the timelock, otherwise the Synth will be burned. If the minter incurs expenses for the minting, using expired price attestation may not be rational.

The Treasury or the public is expected to monitor the network for malicious minting and burn the Synth if needed. If a minting fee is paid in the first stage, the network fee for the burn transaction will be offset by the fee.
