## Description of the Mint part of the protocol

The contract for minting Synth will be split into two stages, `Mint1` and `Mint2` would be
the covenants for respective stages.

In the first stage, the reissuance token will be used to mint an arbitrary amount of Synth.
The reissuance token then will be sent to the same output script that it was spent from.
Thus the reissuance token will be forever locked in the first stage covenant (of course
there might be an "escape hatch"-type branch in that covenant, too)

In the first-stage transaction, the Synth will be sent to the second stage covenant, and
the second-stage covenant will release that Synth only if appropriate amount of the
collateral is sent to be locked in the `Safe` covenant

The first-stage covenant code will construct the second-stage covenant code with the use
of oracle-attested price data, and will ensure that Synth is sent to the covenant that is
identical to that constructed covenant code.

The first-stage covenant code will also ensure that an appropriate bond was posted, to
ensure that any malicious mint attempt will bear significant cost. This bond will be in
L-BTC, and will be sent to the same covenant as the Synth

For constructing the second-stage covenant, the First-stage covenant will use price
and timestamp from oracle-attested price data, and also the amount of the Synth issued,
taken from the introspection of the first-stage transaction data.

Second-stage covenant will have two branches. `Synth-release` branch will release synth
if appropriate amount of collateral is locked in a `Safe`. `Synth-burn` branch will allow anyone
to burn the locked Synth if the oracle-attested price used in the first stage was out-of-date.

Each of these two branches will utilize a timelock, and these timelocks will help to ensure that
the oracle-attested price data that was used in the first stage was recent.

The relative timelock in the `Synth-release` branch of `Mint2` will ensure that the release
of Synth will be possible only after the second stage was in confirmed state for certain time.
Let's call this time t<sub>SR</sub> for "time to Synth release".

The absolute timelock in `Synth-burn` branch of `Mint2` will enable the locked Synth to be burned
by anyone after the network timestamp would exceed the value of 'timestamp of burning'
ts<sub>burn</sub> = (ts<sub>P</sub> + I<sub>P</sub> + T<sub>SR</sub> + T<sub>leeway</sub>), where

- ts<sub>P</sub> is the timestamp from price attestation data used in the first stage
- I<sub>P</sub> is the interval between two subsequent releases of subsequent price attestations by oracle
- T<sub>SR</sub> is "time to Synth release"
- T<sub>leeway</sub> is additional time given for "leeway"

The `Synth-release` branch will also ensure that appropriate amount of Minting Fee is sent to the Treasury

The minter is expected to release Synth and lock their collateral right after T<sub>SR</sub> has passed
after they sent Synth to the second stage, but before the absolute time of the timelock of
`Synth-burn` branch is reached. If mailcious minter uses an expired attestation data, the
timestamp ts<sub>P</sub> will be too far in the past, and the "Burn synth" branch will be enabled right
from the start of the second stage, before the relative timelock of "Synth release" branch
has passed

Since the bond posted at the first stage is sent to the same second-stage covenant as the Synth, this
L-BTC bond will be unlocked to use as part of the collateral in the `Synth-release` branch. In the
`Synth-burn` branch, the L-BTC bond will be unlocked with the burn of the minted Synth, and the creator
of this burn transaction will able to claim the bond for themself

The Treasury, or the public is expected to monitor the network for malicious minting, and burn
Synth in such attempts. The bond released on burn of the Synth in malicious mint attempt will be an
incentive for Treasury or the public to perform the monitoring and burning

### First-stage covenant

To be referred to as `Mint1`

To unlock reissuance token (RT), first-stage covenant code must ensure the following:

- Transaction contains exactly two inputs
  * First input is blinded
  * Second input is unblined, and contains L-BTC (to pay the fee and for the bond)

- Transaction contains three or four outputs
  * Output script of the first output is the same as the output script of the first input
  * Second output is ublinded Synth that goes to second stage covenant
  * Third output is ublinded L-BTC that goes to second stage covenant, with the amount
    required for the bond
  * Next output (may be absent) is unblinded L-BTC (change from the fee and the bond)
  * Last output is the transaction fee (L-BTC)

First stage covenant code must also ensure that second-stage covenant script is the one
that enforces the conditions that correspond to the oracle-attested price rate with timestamp that
were presented to the first-stage covenant. To check for that, first-stage covenant must (partially)
construct the second-stage covenant script, create output script from it (tweaked taproot key),
and compare it with the taproot key in the second output

Because the transaction contains only two inputs, the second input containing L-BTC, the first input
will always be RT. This is because it is RT that we are locking in the covenant, and therefore
it must be present in the inputs

Because RT is present in the inputs, it must be also present in the outputs for the transaction
to be valid. We check that all outputs except the first are unblinded and are not RT, therefore
the first output must be RT

First output may or may not be blinded, we only check that its output script is equal to the output
script of the first input. Because there is only one RT input and one RT output, the amount of
input and output must be the same for the transaction to be valid

There is only one Synth output, and therefore all the issued Synth must be sent to the second-stage
covenant via this second output. The first-stage covenant code can therefore use the amount of
the second output (that is unblinded) to reference the amount issued, even if the issuance data
in the first input is confidential

### Second-stage covenant

To be referred to as `Mint2`

The `Synth-release` branch of the second-stage covenant code must ensure the following:

- T<sub>SR</sub> time has passed since the second-stage covenant utxo was confirmed
- There is expected amount of collateral that is sent to the `Safe` covenant (the amount of collateral
required is calculated at the first stage)

The `Synth-burn` branch of the second-stage covenant code must ensure the following:

- ts<sub>burn</sub> has passed in the network
- All of the Synth issued in the first stage is burned
