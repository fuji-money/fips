## Mint

The contract for minting Synth will be split into two stages, `Mint` and `Claim`.

## Overview

At `Mint` stage, the reissuance token will be used to mint an arbitrary amount of Synth.
The reissuance token then will be sent to the same output script that it was spent from.
Thus the reissuance token will be forever locked in the `Mint` stage covenant (of course
there might be an "escape hatch"-type branch in that covenant, too)

In the `Mint` transaction, the Synth will be sent to the `Claim` covenant, which will release
that Synth only if appropriate amount of the collateral is sent to be locked in the [`Safe`](03.md) covenant

The `Mint` covenant code will construct the `Claim` covenant code with the use of oracle-attested
price data, and will ensure that Synth is sent to the covenant that is identical to that
constructed covenant code.

The `Mint` covenant code will also ensure that an appropriate bond was posted, to ensure that
any malicious mint attempt will bear significant cost. This bond will be in L-BTC, and will be sent
to the same covenant as the Synth

For constructing the `Claim` covenant, the `Mint` covenant will use price and timestamp from
oracle-attested price data, and also the amount of the Synth issued, taken from the introspection
of the `Mint` transaction data.

## Branches

The `Claim` covenant will have two branches:

- **Release** branch will release synth if the appropriate amount of collateral is locked
       in a [`Safe`](03.md).
- `Burn` branch will allow anyone to burn the locked Synth if the oracle-attested price used
       in the `Mint` stage was out-of-date.

Each of these two branches will utilize a timelock, and these timelocks will help to ensure that
the oracle-attested price data that was used in the `Mint` stage was recent.

The relative timelock in the `Synth-release` branch of `Claim` will ensure that the release
of Synth will be possible only after the `Claim` stage utxo was in confirmed state for certain time.
Let's call this time t<sub>SR</sub> for "time to Synth release".

The absolute timelock in `Synth-burn` branch of `Claim` will enable the locked Synth to be burned
by anyone after the network timestamp would exceed the value of **timestamp of burning**
ts<sub>burn</sub> = (ts<sub>P</sub> + I<sub>P</sub> + T<sub>SR</sub> + T<sub>leeway</sub>), where

- ts<sub>P</sub> is the timestamp from price attestation data used in `Mint`
- I<sub>P</sub> is the interval between two subsequent releases of subsequent price attestations by oracle
- T<sub>SR</sub> is "time to Synth release"
- T<sub>leeway</sub> is additional time given for "leeway"

The `Synth-release` branch will also ensure that appropriate amount of Minting Fee is sent to the Treasury

The minter is expected to release Synth and lock their collateral right after T<sub>SR</sub> has passed
after they sent Synth to `Claim`, but before the absolute time of the timelock of `Synth-burn` branch
is reached. If mailcious minter uses an expired attestation data, the timestamp ts<sub>P</sub> will be
too far in the past, and the `Synth-burn` branch will be enabled right from the start of the `Claim` stage,
before the relative timelock of `Synth-release` branch has passed

Since the bond posted at the `Mint` stage is sent to the same `Claim` covenant as the Synth, this
L-BTC bond will be unlocked to use as part of the collateral in the `Synth-release` branch. In the
`Synth-burn` branch, the L-BTC bond will be unlocked with the burn of the minted Synth, and the creator
of this burn transaction will able to claim the bond for themself

The Treasury, or the public is expected to monitor the network for malicious minting, and burn
Synth in such attempts. The bond released on burn of the Synth in malicious mint attempt will be an
incentive for Treasury or the public to perform the monitoring and burning

## Mint covenant

To unlock reissuance token (RT), Mint covenant code must ensure the following:

- Transaction contains exactly two inputs, input 1 is unblined, and contains L-BTC

- Transaction contains three or four outputs
  * Output 0 script the same as the output script of the input 0
  * Output 1 is unblinded Synth that goes to `Claim` covenant
  * Output 2 is unblinded L-BTC that goes to `Claim` covenant, with the amount
    required for the bond
  * Next output (may be absent) is unblinded L-BTC (change from the fee and the bond)
  * Last output is the transaction fee (L-BTC)

`Mint` covenant code must also ensure that `Claim` covenant script is the one that enforces
the conditions that correspond to the oracle-attested price rate with timestamp that were presented
to the `Mint` covenant. To check for that, `Mint` covenant must (partially) construct the `Claim`
covenant script, create output script from it (tweaked taproot key), and compare it with the taproot key
in the output 1

There's no need to check anything about input 0. We only need to check input 1.
This is because the transaction contains exactly two inputs, and if input 1 contains L-BTC,
input 0 will always be RT. It is RT that we are locking in the covenant, and therefore
it must be present in the inputs

Because RT is present in the inputs, it must be also present in the outputs for the transaction
to be valid. We check that all outputs except the output 0 are unblinded and are not RT, therefore
the output 0 must be RT

Output 0 may or may not be blinded, we only check that its output script is equal to the output
script of the input 0. Because there is only one RT input and one RT output, the amount of
input and output must be the same for the transaction to be valid

There is only one Synth output, and therefore all the issued Synth must be sent to the `Claim`
covenant via this output. The `Mint` covenant code can therefore use the amount of this unblinded
output as the amount issued, even if the issuance data in the input 0 is confidential

## Claim covenant

The `Synth-release` branch of the `Claim` covenant code must ensure the following:

- T<sub>SR</sub> time has passed since the `Claim` covenant utxo was confirmed
- There is expected amount of collateral that is sent to the `Safe` covenant (the amount of collateral
required is calculated at `Mint`)
- Minting fee (in Synth) is sent to the Treasury

The `Synth-burn` branch of the `Claim` covenant code must ensure the following:

- ts<sub>burn</sub> has passed in the network
- All of the Synth issued at `Mint` is burned
