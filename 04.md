# FIP-04

## Issuance of Fuji assets 

The contract for minting Synth will be split into two stages, `Mint` and `Claim`.

## Overview

At `Mint` stage, the reissuance token will be used to mint an arbitrary amount of Synth.
The reissuance token then will be sent to the same output script that it was spent from.
Thus the reissuance token will be forever locked in the `Mint` stage covenant, and can
only be destroyed by Treasury, in a special tracsaction to 'burn' the token

In the `Mint` transaction, the Synth will be sent to the `Claim` covenant, which will release
that Synth only if appropriate amount of the collateral is sent to be locked in the [`Safe`](03.md) covenant

The `Mint` covenant code will construct the `Claim` covenant code with the use of oracle-attested
price data, and will ensure that Synth is sent to the covenant that is identical to that
constructed covenant code.

The `Mint` covenant code will also ensure that an appropriate bond was posted, to ensure that
any malicious mint attempt will bear significant cost. This bond will be in L-BTC, and will be sent
to the same covenant as the Synth

For constructing the `Claim` covenant, the `Mint` covenant will use price and timestamp from
oracle-attested price data, and also the amount of the Synth issued, taken from the introspection
of the `Mint` transaction data.

## Branches

The `Mint` covenant will have two branches:

- **Mint** branch will ensure the main function of the Mint covenant, that is, to allow spending of
       reissuance token to mint the Synth when all the requirements are met
- **RTBurn** branch will allow the Treasury to destroy the reissuance token at any time

The `Claim` covenant will have two branches:

- **Release** branch will release synth if the appropriate amount of collateral is locked
       in a [`Safe`](03.md).
- **Burn** branch will allow anyone to burn the locked Synth if the oracle-attested price used
       in the `Mint` stage was out-of-date.

Each of these two branches will utilize a timelock, and these timelocks will help to ensure that
the oracle-attested price data that was used in the `Mint` stage was recent.

The relative timelock in the `Release` branch of `Claim` will ensure that the release
of Synth will be possible only after the `Claim` stage utxo was in confirmed state for certain time.
Let's call this time t<sub>SR</sub> for "time to Synth release".

The absolute timelock in `Burn` branch of `Claim` will enable the locked Synth to be burned
by anyone after the network timestamp would exceed the value of **timestamp of burning**
ts<sub>burn</sub> = (ts<sub>P</sub> + I<sub>P</sub> + T<sub>SR</sub> + T<sub>leeway</sub>), where

- ts<sub>P</sub> is the timestamp from price attestation data used in `Mint`
- I<sub>P</sub> is the interval between two subsequent releases of subsequent price attestations by oracle
- T<sub>SR</sub> is "time to Synth release"
- T<sub>leeway</sub> is additional time given for "leeway"

The `Release` branch will also ensure that appropriate amount of Minting Fee is sent to the Treasury

The minter is expected to release Synth and lock their collateral right after T<sub>SR</sub> has passed
after they sent Synth to `Claim`, but before the absolute time of the timelock of `Burn` branch
is reached. If mailcious minter uses an expired attestation data, the timestamp ts<sub>P</sub> will be
too far in the past, and the `Burn` branch will be enabled right from the start of the `Claim` stage,
before the relative timelock of `Release` branch has passed

Since the bond posted at the `Mint` stage is sent to the same `Claim` covenant as the Synth, this
L-BTC bond will be unlocked to use as part of the collateral in the `Release` branch. In the
`Burn` branch, the L-BTC bond will be unlocked with the burn of the minted Synth, and the creator
of this burn transaction will able to claim the bond for themself

The Treasury, or the public is expected to monitor the network for malicious minting, and burn
Synth in such attempts. The bond released on burn of the Synth in malicious mint attempt will be an
incentive for Treasury or the public to perform the monitoring and burning

## Mint covenant

### The `Mint` branch

Must ensure the following:

- Transaction contains exactly two inputs
  * Input 1 is unblined, and contains L-BTC

- Transaction contains four or five outputs
  * Output 0 script is the same as the output script of input 0
  * Output 1 is unblinded Synth that goes to `Claim` covenant
  * Output 2 is unblinded L-BTC that goes to `Claim` covenant, with the amount
    required for the bond
  * Next output (may be absent) is unblinded L-BTC (change from the bond)
  * Last output is unblinded L-BTC (network fee)

`Mint` covenant code must also ensure that `Claim` covenant script is the one that enforces
the conditions that correspond to the oracle-attested price rate with timestamp that were presented
to the `Mint` covenant. To check for that, `Mint` covenant must (partially) construct the `Claim`
covenant script, create output script from it (tweaked taproot key), and compare it with the taproot key
in the output 1 and output 2

There's no need to check anything about input 0. We only need to check input 1.
This is because the transaction contains exactly two inputs, and if input 1 contains L-BTC,
input 0 will always be RT. It is RT that we are locking in the covenant, and therefore
it must be present in the inputs

Because RT is present in the inputs, it must be also present in the outputs for the transaction
to be valid. We check that all outputs except the output 0 are unblinded and are not RT, therefore
the output 0 must be RT

Output 0 may or may not be blinded, we only check that its output script is equal to the output
script of the input 0. Because there is only one RT input and one RT output, the amount of
input and output must be the same for the transaction to be valid

There is only one Synth output, and therefore all the issued Synth must be sent to the `Claim`
covenant via this output. The `Mint` covenant code can therefore use the amount of this unblinded
output as the amount issued, even if the issuance data in the input 0 is confidential

There could be an argument that 'exactly two inputs' restriction is not needed, as one can use
`OP_PUSHCURRENTINPUTINDEX` to get the scriptpubkey of the RT output being spent and to compare
it to output 0 scriptpubkey. But allowing more inputs would allow spending more than one RT utxo
in the same Mint transaction, with value of that utxo being consolidated in output 0.
This is not desireable, as it will allow reducing the number of RT utxo available for use in minting

### The `RTBurn` branch

Must ensure the following:

- Transaction contains two or tree outputs
  * Output 0 script is the `OP_RETURN` burn script
  * Next output (may be absent) is unblinded L-BTC (change)
  * Last output is unblinded L-BTC (network fee)

- Transaction is signed with Treasury key that is designated for burning reissuance tokens

Because we check that all outputs except output 0 are unblinded L-BTC, and RT is present in the inputs,
output 0 must be RT. The transaction can have more than one RT input, and thus treasury will be able
to burn many RT utxo at once.

## Claim covenant

### The `Release` branch

Must ensure the following:

- T<sub>SR</sub> time has passed since the `Claim` covenant utxo was confirmed
- There is expected amount of collateral that is sent to the `Safe` covenant (the amount of collateral
required is calculated at `Mint`)
- Minting fee (in Synth) is sent to the Treasury

### The `Burn` branch

Must ensure the following:

- ts<sub>burn</sub> has passed in the network
- All of the Synth issued at `Mint` is burned
